#Project in the Algorithm course - MTA 2021
=====================================================================
>This project is about implementing 2 algorithms of determining the shortest path from some source vertex to other vertices in a directed weighted graph. 
> - Bellman Ford
> - Dijkstra (with 2 different implementations of a priority queue)

There are 2 representations of a graph in this project:
- A graph represented by an adjacency list
- A graph represented by an adjacency matrix


For each type of graph, we measure the time taken to compute the two algorithms, and print the results to an external file (received via command line argument).
On top of that, the final result of the weight from the source vertex to the destination vertex is printed to the console.
